Utilizes pyautogui to automate the manual downloading of files from outdated Carrier websites, consolidates the files, and uploads them to an agency management system. It's pretty messy and was designed to see how accurate and effective pyautogui was. Don't try using this in production, I have not included the images necessary to run the script successfully. In all honesty this should be done with something like Selenium. '

As for pyautogui...it could be helpful in a pinch, but I was only able to get it to work using grayscale and a specific resolution. Kudos to asweigart for writing such a neat program.
